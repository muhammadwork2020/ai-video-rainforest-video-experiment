# 🎬 AI Video Experiments by Muhammad

Welcome to my creative sandbox for AI-generated video projects. I'm exploring storytelling, prompt engineering, and visual design using generative tools. Each video is part of my learning journey—some polished, some experimental—but all reflect curiosity, growth, and a love for visual storytelling.

## 🌲 Glowing Forest — First Attempt

A cinematic forest scene with glowing mushrooms and bioluminescent fog. This was my first try at prompt-based video generation.

📄 Prompt: [`glowing-forest-prompt.json`](prompts/glowing-forest-prompt.json)  
🎥 Video: [`rainforest ai video.mp4`](assets/rainforest%20ai%20video.mp4)


> ⚠️ GitHub doesn’t support direct playback of `.mp4` files.  
> To watch the video:
> 1. Click the link above.
> 2. On the GitHub file page, click the **“Download”** button.
> 3. Open the file in your browser or video player.

### ✅ Highlights
- Strong atmosphere and lighting
- Smooth camera transitions
- Mushrooms felt alive and reactive

### 🔍 Lessons Learned
- Needed better pacing
- Fog layering could be improved

## 🦖 Petri Dish Dinosaur Ecosystem — Second Attempt

Inspired by the idea of a prehistoric ecosystem emerging from glowing liquid inside a petri dish. Shared on TikTok and got ~700 views!

📄 Prompt: [`petri-ecosystem-prompt.json`](prompts/petri-ecosystem-prompt.json)  
🎥 Video: [`dinosaur ai video.mp4`](assets/dinosaur%20ai%20video.mp4)

> ⚠️ GitHub doesn’t support direct playback of `.mp4` files.  
> To watch the video:
> 1. Click the link above.
> 2. On the GitHub file page, click the **“Download”** button.
> 3. Open the file in your browser or video player.

### ✅ Highlights
- Cool concept with glowing liquid and plant growth
- Dinosaurs added visual interest
- Friends said it looked “quite nice” 😄

### 🔍 Lessons Learned
- Liquid didn’t visibly absorb into sand
- Dinosaurs were too large for the scale
- Scenes felt disconnected

## 🚀 What’s Next

I’m continuing to refine my prompts, storytelling, and visual consistency. Each project helps me understand how to better control AI outputs and create immersive scenes.

Feel free to explore, give feedback, or follow along as I build more!
