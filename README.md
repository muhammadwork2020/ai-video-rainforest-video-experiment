# 🌿 Rainforest AI Video Project

This project explores the use of AI to generate a short video about the rainforest, combining creative prompts with automated video synthesis. It's part of my journey into AI-powered media generation and cloud-based asset management.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `prompt.json` — Contains the structured prompt used to generate the video.
- `assets/` — Folder holding the final video output and placeholder files.
  - `rainforest ai video.mp4` — The generated video.
  - `.gitkeep` — Keeps the folder tracked in Git.
