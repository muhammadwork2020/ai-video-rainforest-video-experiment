  "description": "Ultra realistic close-up of a small transparent glass half-bowl, like a science lab terrarium, half-filled with golden sea sand on a white table. A single water droplet falls into the center of the sand, then instantly a lush miniature rainforest grows inside in timelapse: green sprouts, vines, tiny rivers, and small realistic animals like birds and butterflies appear. Cinematic lighting, 8K detail, shallow depth of field.",
